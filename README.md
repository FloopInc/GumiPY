### About Hotfix (Optional)
- If you have trouble failing to request the url for the hotfix graber, you can replace the hotfix.py code with the [old version](https://github.com/FloopInc/GumiPY/blob/491bfc744303962b4aa270472e274474463fd23f/command/hotfix.py) & modify code to grab the latest hotfix from [this repo](https://github.com/PutraZC/HSR_Data/blob/main/hotfix.json)
- For hotfixes I will probably rarely / will not update the link in this repo, so if you need the latest link, you can grab it manual or [check this repo](https://github.com/PutraZC/HSR_Data/blob/main/hotfix.json#L2-L5)
